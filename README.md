# Farcaster SubQuery Era Frame

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (Version 18 or later)
- A text editor like VSCode
- Basic understanding of TypeScript and Node.js

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sq-ext/farcaster-subquery-era-frame.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd farcaster-frames-template
   ```
3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```
4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   pnpm run dev
   ```

### Usage Guide

The template uses [Localtunnel](https://github.com/localtunnel/localtunnel) which allows you to easily test your frames without the need to deploy them. Everytime running your project, you will receive a random URL, for example `https://thirty-glasses-tell.loca.lt`. You can directly copy this URL and test your frame using the [Warpcast Embed Tools](https://warpcast.com/~/developers/embeds). This makes the development and testing process much more efficient and straightforward.
